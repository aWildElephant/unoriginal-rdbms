# Row-based in-memory java relational database management system

This project will not have any distinguishing feature. Its sole purpose is to allow me to implement or try to implement every part of an RDBMS.

## Milestones
- prior to 2019-04-14: support stuff for TPC-H Q1, load TPC-H scale factor 1 dataset, improve muscle mass, etc.
- 2019-04-14: TPC-H Q1 support (ran in around 13s)

## Next steps

- Fix TODOs
- Support concurrent queries, probably by having a global queue and executing them one at a time
- Improve loading speed of the TPC-H scale factor 1 dataset (currently around 1 minute)
- Support runnin as a standalone server
- Support TPC-H Q2
