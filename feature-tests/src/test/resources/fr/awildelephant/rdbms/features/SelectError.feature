Feature: Select error

  Scenario: I select a column that doesn't exist in the table

    Given the table z
      | y       |
      | INTEGER |
      | 1       |

    When I execute the query
    """
    SELECT x FROM z
    """

    Then I expect an error with the message
    """
    Column not found: x
    """

  Scenario: I query a table that doesn't exist

      SELECT * FROM UnknownTable
      """

    Then I expect an error with the message
      """
      Table not found: UnknownTable
      """
