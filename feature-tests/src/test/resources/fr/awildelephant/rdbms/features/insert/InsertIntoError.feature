Feature: Insert Into errors

  Scenario: I try to insert in a table that doesn't exist

    When I execute the query
    """
    INSERT INTO UnknownTable VALUES (1);
    """

    Then I expect an error with the message
    """
    Table not found: unknowntable
    """

  Scenario: I try to insert a row that doesn't have enough columns for the table

    Given the table people
    | id      | name |
    | INTEGER | TEXT |

    When I execute the query
    """
    INSERT INTO people VALUES (1)
    """

    Then I expect an error with the message
    """
    Column count mismatch: expected 2 but got 1
    """
