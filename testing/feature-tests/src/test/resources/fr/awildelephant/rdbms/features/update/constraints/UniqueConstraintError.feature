Feature: Unique constraint error

  Scenario: I try to add an unique constraint on a column that does not exist

    When I execute the query
      """
      CREATE TABLE test (a INTEGER, UNIQUE(b))
      """

    Then I expect an error with the message
      """
      Column not found: b
      """

  Scenario: I try to add an unique constraint on several columns and one of them doesn't exist

    When I execute the query
      """
      CREATE TABLE test (a INTEGER, UNIQUE (a, b))
      """

    Then I expect an error with the message
      """
      Column not found: b
      """
