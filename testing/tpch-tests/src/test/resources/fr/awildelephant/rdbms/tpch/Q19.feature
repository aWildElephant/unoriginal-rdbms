Feature: TPC-H Q19

  Background: TPC-H dataset

    Given I load lineitem scale factor 1
    And I load part scale factor 1

  Scenario: I execute TPC-H Q19

    When I execute the query
    """
    SELECT
      SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
    FROM
      lineitem,
      part
    WHERE
      (
        p_partkey = l_partkey
        AND p_brand = 'Brand#12'
        AND p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
        AND l_quantity >= 1
        AND l_quantity <= 1 + 10
        AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5
        AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
        AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
      )
      OR
      (
        p_partkey = l_partkey
        AND p_brand = 'Brand#23'
        AND p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
        AND l_quantity >= 10
        AND l_quantity <= 10 + 10
        AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10
        AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
        AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
      )
      OR
      (
        p_partkey = l_partkey
        AND p_brand = 'Brand#34'
        AND p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
        AND l_quantity >= 20
        AND l_quantity <= 20 + 10
        AND p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15
        AND l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
        AND l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
      );
    """

    Then I expect the result
      | revenue    |
      | DECIMAL    |
      | 3083843.05 |
