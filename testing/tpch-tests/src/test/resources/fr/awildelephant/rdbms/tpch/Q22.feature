@todo # Broken by subquery unnesting refactoring
Feature: TPC-H Q22

  Background: TPC-H dataset

    Given I load customer scale factor 1
    And I load orders scale factor 1

  Scenario: I execute TPC-H Q22

    When I execute the query
    """

      cntrycode,
      COUNT(*) AS numcust,
      SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
