Feature: TPC-H Q8

  Background: TPC-H dataset

    Given I load customer scale factor 1
    And I load lineitem scale factor 1
    And I load nation scale factor 1
    And I load orders scale factor 1
    And I load part scale factor 1
    And I load region scale factor 1
    And I load supplier scale factor 1

  Scenario: I execute TPC-H Q8

    When I execute the query

    Then I expect the result
